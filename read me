This is a simple calculator program written in Python that runs in the terminal. 
It helps the user do basic math operations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers.
ðŸ‘‰ The program uses functions â€” small sections of code that do a job:
add: adds two numbers.
subtract: subtracts one number from another.
multiply: multiplies two numbers.
divide: divides one number by another.
ðŸ‘‰ It uses variables to store values the user gives:
num1 stores the first number.
num2 stores the next number.
answer stores the result of the calculation.
ðŸ‘‰ The program shows symbols (+, -, *, /) and asks the user to choose an operation.
ðŸ‘‰ After calculating, it asks:
Do you want to keep calculating with the current result? (The user types y for yes)
Or do you want to start a new calculation? (The user types n for no)
ðŸ‘‰ This is done using a choice variable where the user types y or n.
ðŸ‘‰ The program uses a loop â€” this means it keeps running again and again until the user chooses to stop or start fresh.
ðŸ‘‰ To make the output fun, the program prints a calculator picture (ASCII art).
